I figured out that and used the kmymoney profiles only. As also further pointed by Ralf, the onlinequoteseditor (in libalkimia) is intended to support multiple applications and therefore adds multiple profiles.</p><p>As unit tests were already written in libalkmia I run all the tests to check if something were wrong. All the tests passed successfully.</p><p>I started replacing WebPriceQuote implementation with that of Alkimia one by one. I managed to do so with the help of API documentation and previous KMyMoney 4.8 implementation. I found that some of the implementations were not present in libalkimia :</p><ul><li>AlkOnlineQuote::csvquote() as opposed to WebPriceQuote::csvquote()</li></ul><p>For this Ralf pointed out that it uses the type MyMoneyStatement as the second parameter only known by kmymoney and therefore cannot be added to alkimia and Thomas suggested I move over it as the whole CSV import is needed to be reworked and is currently out of the scope of GSoC project.</p><ul><li><p>I also tried to implement AlkOnlineQuote::setDate() I got a reference error which was due to m_fromDate and m_toDate in WebPriceQuote are only used in connection with CSV downloads and Thomas said me to skip that.</p></li><li><p>Thomas said me to add two more members to AlkOnlineQuoteSource::Private: , m_idNumber (QString) and m_idSelector (enum). For that, I implemented the m_idNumber in private and the idSelector enum in public since it was to be used in the getter and setter function outside private.</p></li></ul><p>Alkimia build was successful. I am also working in the modifications in AlkOnlineQuoteSource constructors with these new members and its tests.</p><p>My work can be found here : <a href=https://invent.kde.org/surajsloth/alkimia/-/tree/gsoc21>Alkimia</a> and <a href=https://invent.kde.org/surajsloth/kmymoney/-/tree/gsoc21>KMyMoney</a>.</p><h2 id=learnings-->Learnings -</h2><p>My object-oriented concepts improved and I learned how to implement and modify tests.</p><h2 id=whats-next-->What&rsquo;s next -</h2><p>Phase 1 ended and there are now evaluations. The initial part of my project started slow since I was taking time to get acquainted more with the codebase. It is great to have such helpful mentors who help me with my queries as early as possible. I have planned to put on more time in my project as required. Work for the next work involves replacing the left WebPriceQuote APIs.<br>If anyone wants to suggest something or have a discussion please reach out to me on suraj[dot]mahto49[at]gmail[dot]com or @suraj_sloth:kde.org in matrix.</p></article></main><footer id=footer>Copyright ¬© 2022 Suraj</footer></body></html>
