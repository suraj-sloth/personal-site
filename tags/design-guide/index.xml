&lt;hr>
&lt;p>I had this really interesting task for my &lt;a href="https://school.takshashila.org.in/gcpp-technology-policy">GCPP&lt;/a> assignment with the Takshashila Institution. The goal? To gather around 10 folks for a community exercise on any topic. We chose something related to urban management. I roped in a mix of family and friends to join this virtual pow-wow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our group was a diverse bunch – ages ranged from 20 to 50, and we had everyone from software engineers to folks prepping for civil services. We wanted to tackle what makes cities tick – you know, the stuff like livability, tech integration, and infrastructure that makes urban life better.
The discussion points being:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Livable and Prosperous Environments&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Inclusive Engagement of Stakeholders&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Citizen-Centric Approach with Technology Integration&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Focus on Ease of Living and Civic Sense&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Infrastructure Development Priorities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Regulation in Real Estate and Mitigating Income Disparity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Investment in Education, Low Crime Rates, and Law Enforcement&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Promotion of Diversity and Migrant Support&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sustainable Environmental Planning and Infrastructure Development&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>When we got down to the status quo , our discussions uncovered a laundry list of urban challenges. From overcrowding to water scarcity, messy urban planning, slum issues, and this rising class of urban dreamers, we had a laundry list of problems staring at us. Some discussion points were:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Population Explosion and Urbanization Trends:&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Resource Constraints, particularly Water&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Economic Shift Towards the Service Sector, Tech-Driven&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unorganized Sector and Invisible Urban Planning&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Slum Rehabilitation and Urban Cleanliness&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cosmopolitan Centers and Diversity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Infrastructure Challenges and Expansion Beyond Metropolitans&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Social and Economic Remittances&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Consumerism and Aspirational Class&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vehicle Counts and Strain on Urban Planning&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We also dived into stakeholder mapping. Exploring how different players influence city decisions was like piecing together a puzzle.
&lt;img src="https://suraj-sloth.github.io/blog-smap-18-11-23.png" alt="stakeholder mapping">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our brainstorming sessions were fire! We talked about investing in infrastructure, fair real estate rules, education boosts, law enforcement, helping migrants settle, and making cities more eco-friendly. The discussion points were:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Invest in upgrading road networks, expanding public transportation, and enforcing office shuttle services to reduce individual vehicular usage and traffic congestion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enforce fair real estate regulations to ensure equitable access to housing. Implement inclusive policies that mitigate income disparity and uplift marginalized communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Invest in government educational institutes to provide quality education, empowering all segments of society. Encourage skill development programs for better employment prospects for all strata.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Strengthen law enforcement to maintain low crime rates. Promote civic education and community engagement to foster a sense of responsibility among citizens.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create policies that celebrate diversity and provide support systems for migrants, ensuring they are integrated into the city&amp;rsquo;s social and economic fabric.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Embrace sustainable urban planning practices, along with better rainwater management systems and advanced waste management integrating technology to create smarter, more efficient cities that prioritize environmental conservation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Foster a citizen-centric approach by engaging all stakeholders like urban local bodies in decision-making processes, ensuring that diverse perspectives contribute to urban development plans.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We voted to deep-dive into the topic of &lt;strong>Real estate and Income inequality&lt;/strong>. It was intense but super insightful. We tossed around ideas like making housing more accessible, controlling rents, boosting wages, and fighting housing discrimination head-on with laws and education. The solutions discussed were:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Accessibility&lt;/strong>: Enhancing accessibility to housing involves addressing both supply and demand-side factors. On the supply side, increasing the availability of affordable housing units through zoning reforms, public-private partnerships, and tax incentives for developers can help meet the demand for affordable housing. On the demand side, providing financial assistance programs, such as housing vouchers or rental subsidies, can help low-income households afford decent housing.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Affordability&lt;/strong>: Ensuring affordability requires a combination of measures, including rent control, wage increases, and expanding the supply of affordable housing. Rent control can temporarily mitigate rising rents, but it&amp;rsquo;s important to consider long-term implications and potential impacts on housing supply. Increase in wages can help households cover housing costs effectively. Expanding the supply of affordable housing can be achieved through zoning reforms, public-private partnerships (PPP), and tax incentives for developers.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Discrimination&lt;/strong>: Preventing discrimination including the migrated population in housing requires robust anti-discrimination laws, fair housing enforcement, and public education campaigns. Anti-discrimination laws should clearly define prohibited discriminatory practices and provide effective remedies for victims. Fair housing enforcement involves monitoring and investigation of discriminatory practices, as well as timely and effective action against violators. Public education campaigns can raise awareness about fair housing laws and encourage inclusive housing practices.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This wasn’t just an assignment. It was a collective vision of making our cities way better. It taught me how to manage diverse ideas, and pivot to real solutions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We are talking about handheld devices in general. With the increase in affordability and consumerism, Electronic waste, or e-waste, is a growing problem that poses a significant threat to the environment and human health. Technology, including open technologies, can play a crucial role in addressing this issue by promoting sustainability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the Debian Conference 2023 [0] held in September at Kochi (DebConf &amp;lsquo;23), I presented a compelling tech use case [0]. I showcased how repurposing old smartphones to create a clustered system harnesses their computational power for specific applications, providing an innovative solution to both reduce e-waste and utilize resources effectively.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="the-pressing-need-for-sustainable-e-waste-management">The Pressing Need for Sustainable E-waste Management&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The world grapples with a growing e-waste crisis, discarding an alarming 53.6 million metric tons annually, with only 17.4% being formally collected and recycled [1]. This alarming trend poses significant environmental and health hazards, particularly in developing nations. Moreover, e-waste contains hazardous substances, further endangering human well-being and the environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="technology-as-a-catalyst-for-e-waste-sustainability">Technology as a Catalyst for E-waste Sustainability&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Embracing technology presents a crucial opportunity to achieve sustainable e-waste management. Open technologies and Open-source software emerges as a powerful tool in promoting sustainability and combating e-waste. By democratizing access through freely available software, these initiatives reduce technological costs, bridge the global digital divide, and foster economic development. Furthermore, they open doors to eco-conscious projects that embrace sustainability [3].&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="policy--strategies-that-can-enable-e-waste-sustainability-via-technology-and-open-technology">Policy Strategies that can Enable E-waste Sustainability via Technology and Open Technology&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Realizing e-waste sustainability demands a multifaceted approach. Policy strategies that harness technology and open-source software include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Developing Sustainable Economic Models&lt;/strong>: Creating economic models sustains the development and maintenance of open-source software [6].&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Designing for Repairability&lt;/strong>: Crafting electronics for easy repair extends their lifespan, aided by open-source software&amp;rsquo;s creation of repair manuals and tools [4].&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Promoting Open Standards&lt;/strong>: Open-source software facilitates the development of standards promoting device interoperability, reducing e-waste [2].&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Collaborating with Organizations associated with the 17 SDGs&lt;/strong>: Partnerships between open-source projects, tech companies, and environmental groups spawn eco-friendly initiatives fostering sustainability [3].&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Harnessing a Circular Economy [7] for ICT Equipment contradistinction to the traditional linear economy&lt;/strong>: A circular economy for ICT devices mitigates e-waste by using the device to its best capacity for a good value proposition.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Continuing this journey, I am iterating on that solution and will be presenting about the same at the upcoming GNOME Asia Summit 2023, set to happen in December at Kathmandu. This platform will further enable the exploration and improvement of this impactful approach to combat e-waste.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Consumerism perpetuates the notion that happiness is linked to material possessions. However, spiritual teachings across various traditions emphasize detachment from material desires. This paradox poses a fundamental question: Can the credit-driven pursuit of material wealth coexist with spirituality?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Purushartha i.e. the objective of a human being states about four aims, one of which is artha . Multiple texts bring different dimensions to it, one of which is Kautilya&amp;rsquo;s Arthashastra. To the Indian context credit in retail banking is quite a new concept.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s wild world, it feels like everywhere you turn, someone&amp;rsquo;s pitching a sale. Commercials scream about flashy lifestyles, and our social feeds are a constant stream of quick dopamine and the latest &amp;ldquo;you gotta-have-it&amp;rdquo; things.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>But here&amp;rsquo;s the twist: more research suggests that all this chasing after stuff might actually be making us sadder. A 2018 study in the Journal of Consumer Research found that folks fixated on owning things tend to feel less satisfied with life. It&amp;rsquo;s like they&amp;rsquo;re too caught up in what others think and in having flashy status symbols, forgetting what really counts like connections and personal growth [1]. The pressure to buy might really be messing with people&amp;rsquo;s heads in this attention economy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is about easy credit, too. Those tempting loans and cards that make it too easy to splash cash we don&amp;rsquo;t have. turns out, that&amp;rsquo;s part of the problem too. Overspending and stacking up debt can feel like a rollercoaster of stress and anxiety, messing with our heads big time. Debt can pile on feelings of guilt, fear of missing out and ego.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What if we could teach the next generation how to navigate the tricky waters of debt and spending? Empowering them with budgeting know-how and the dangers of over-reliance on credit could be a game-changer in breaking the cycle of debt-induced stress.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="navigating-through-it">Navigating through it&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>But that’s not all. Let’s imagine a world where businesses are nudged towards sustainability and ethical practices. A shift in focus from quantity over quality could ripple through society, fostering a culture that prioritizes experiences and long-term satisfaction over the fleeting thrill of a new purchase.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And what if we tapped into the power of spirituality to fill the void? Mindfulness practices and a focus on inner growth could offer an alternative path to fulfillment, one that doesn’t rely on material possessions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what if we dared to challenge the ingrained “buy more, be happy” mantra? What if a combination of proactive policies, education, and a societal values overhaul could steer us away from this relentless pursuit of consumerism?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps it’s time for a collective rethink – individuals and policymakers alike – to reimagine the role of consumerism in our lives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what&amp;rsquo;s the fix? Some psychologists, like Tim Kasser, say we&amp;rsquo;ve got to switch gears. Instead of chasing after stuff, they reckon we should focus on things that actually make us happy&amp;mdash;like building relationships, growing personally, and getting involved in our communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seems like maybe we&amp;rsquo;ve got it backward. It&amp;rsquo;s not about what we own; it&amp;rsquo;s about what we do and who we are. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s time to get into spirituality and consider the idea of bowing down to the wealth that brings peace and fills the body with joy.&lt;/p>

This project has been a roller coaster ride for me. With initial weeks of struggling to understand the large codebase to this point.
Week 9-10 revolved around testing all the changes done in the coding period. I had a virtual meet on the 7th of August with mentors. Thank you to them to organize a meet of their schedule,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The meet after many weeks was great. Mentors asked for my feedback about the current progress. I presented my work and discussed some possible bugs that I found while working on the project. One of which was the renaming of quotes not working. Thomas said that it was solved a few days ago but not in the master branch since my ongoing work was in a branch off the master.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We discussed how to rebase my branch from upstream and make it merge ready. I followed the instruction of mentors to demonstrate the working of kmymoney using sample data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We found that the GNUCash plugin doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work after changes. It later worked(probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t working due to a linking error with my local alkimia installation). The equity price update doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work. I think it was because of the incomplete porting of webpricequote APIs since I commented on all the csvquote usage which is to be ported after the GSoC timeline.&lt;/p>
&lt;center>&lt;img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/7J4P7cUur2DlErijp3/giphy.gif" width="50%" height="50%">&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/manny-manny404-mannynotfound-7J4P7cUur2DlErijp3">via GIPHY&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/center>
&lt;p>There is also a signal &lt;code>void updateAvailable(const QString &amp;amp;profile, const QString &amp;amp;name);&lt;/code> which is emitted by slot &lt;code>void slotUpdatesFound(const KNS3::Entry::List &amp;amp;updates)&lt;/code> to log updates for quote sources installed through KNS3 DownloadManager. It requires modification to work. This deliverable was not completed in the coding period. All the work is now in form of a merge request. After working on the csvquote, all the features will be workable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am also refactoring the code in my merge request as per the suggestions of mentors and maintainers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My work can be found here : &lt;a href="https://invent.kde.org/surajsloth/alkimia/-/tree/gsoc21">Alkimia&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://invent.kde.org/surajsloth/kmymoney/-/tree/gsoc21">KMyMoney&lt;/a>. Both have been used to create a Merge Request for upstream repos.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="post-gsoc--">Post GSoC -&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The most trivial stuff will be to get the csvquote API ported to make features work like CSV field and update of quotes &lt;a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=439411">https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=439411&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

For people not much into finance, an article from &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quote.asp">Investopedia&lt;/a> about quotes.
&lt;br>
I first replaced the WebPriceQuote constructors and their members of AlkOnlineQuoteSource. Replacing m_webIDBy with m_idSelector popped up error. After putting in a little effort I remembered that m_idSelector is the member of AlkOnlineQuoteSource::Private and I will have to use the getter(idSelector()) to use that member for an AlkOnlineQuoteSource object.
&lt;br>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I ended up with compile errors which were due to an undefined reference to idSelector(). Since the definition and declaration of that function were already there pointing that it was maybe due to a linking error. I checked the symlink of libalkimia shared object(alkimia/build/bin/libalkimia5.so.8) that I created in kmymoney/build/lib to use my local modified version of alkimia. I still ended up with the same errors. After discussion in the mailing list, Ralf, Thomas and Ingo and their valuable suggestions, it was concluded that to make the &lt;strong>loader&lt;/strong> work according to my local alkimia in &lt;strong>build time&lt;/strong> I have to pass: &lt;code>-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=&amp;lt;root-dir&amp;gt;/alkimia-install/usr/local&lt;/code> as an argument to CMake while building kmymoney where alkimia-install is my custom install location.&lt;/p>
&lt;br>
My work can be found here : [Alkimia](https://invent.kde.org/surajsloth/alkimia/-/tree/gsoc21) and [KMyMoney](https://invent.kde.org/surajsloth/kmymoney/-/tree/gsoc21).
## Learnings -
I got to know more about linkers and loaders and to use locally modified libs in a client application.

&lt;p>The plan for the post first evals week was to complete the following tasks:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Make changes as suggested by mentors on my last work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Modify the AlkOnlineQuoteSource constructor for new members (m_idSelector and m_idNumber)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Write unit tests for the added members in the AlkOnlineQuoteSource.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;br>
I modified the code as suggested by my mentors that were related to coding conventions(according to C++, Qt and KDE).
&lt;p>After adding the new members to the AlkOnlineQuoteSource constructor. I jumped into writing the unit tests. I realized that I haven&amp;rsquo;t added the new members in the function signature. After adding that, I build the files to check what all things break related to the constructor&amp;rsquo;s usage. They were :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>defaultQuoteSources() - The function having default quote sources. I modified those according to the new signature with quotes data from webpricequote.
&lt;br>
I proceeded to work on tests then and modified the test functions according to the new signature. I ran all the tests only to realize later that alkonlinequotesourcetest fails. It was due to the undeclared IdSelector variable. After fixing(assigning a default type) it was very relaxing to see all tests pass.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;br>
My work can be found here : [Alkimia](https://invent.kde.org/surajsloth/alkimia/-/tree/gsoc21) and [KMyMoney](https://invent.kde.org/surajsloth/kmymoney/-/tree/gsoc21).

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Write unit tests for the debug support.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Work on the Online Quote support :
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Use the member functions of AlkOnlineQuote class and AlkOnlineQuoteSource class.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Start the work on the “update of online quote support” feature.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Week 5 was more into replacing the WebPriceQuote usage in KMyMoney and figuring out what APIs are needed in libalkimia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I noticed that the online quotes that were in kmymoneyrc weren&amp;rsquo;t visible in the Online Quotes dialog. I figured out that and used the kmymoney profiles only. As also further pointed by Ralf, the onlinequoteseditor (in libalkimia) is intended to support multiple applications and therefore adds multiple profiles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As unit tests were already written in libalkmia I run all the tests to check if something were wrong. All the tests passed successfully.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started replacing WebPriceQuote implementation with that of Alkimia one by one. I managed to do so with the help of API documentation and previous KMyMoney 4.8 implementation. I found that some of the implementations were not present in libalkimia :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>AlkOnlineQuote::csvquote() as opposed to WebPriceQuote::csvquote()&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For this Ralf pointed out that it uses the type MyMoneyStatement as the second parameter only known by kmymoney and therefore cannot be added to alkimia and Thomas suggested I move over it as the whole CSV import is needed to be reworked and is currently out of the scope of GSoC project.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I also tried to implement AlkOnlineQuote::setDate() I got a reference error which was due to m_fromDate and m_toDate in WebPriceQuote are only used in connection with CSV downloads and Thomas said me to skip that.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Thomas said me to add two more members to AlkOnlineQuoteSource::Private: , m_idNumber (QString) and m_idSelector (enum). For that, I implemented the m_idNumber in private and the idSelector enum in public since it was to be used in the getter and setter function outside private.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Alkimia build was successful. I am also working in the modifications in AlkOnlineQuoteSource constructors with these new members and its tests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My work can be found here : &lt;a href="https://invent.kde.org/surajsloth/alkimia/-/tree/gsoc21">Alkimia&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://invent.kde.org/surajsloth/kmymoney/-/tree/gsoc21">KMyMoney&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My object-oriented concepts improved and I learned how to implement and modify tests.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Phase 1 ended and there are now evaluations. The initial part of my project started slow since I was taking time to get acquainted more with the codebase. It is great to have such helpful mentors who help me with my queries as early as possible. I have planned to put on more time in my project as required. Work for the next work involves replacing the left WebPriceQuote APIs.

I started using KDevelop for the project. The plan for the first phase was to complete the following tasks:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Replace functions related to widgets in the existing codebase with that of the alkimiawidgets library.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Work on adding the debug support :
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Add the UI entry for debug support in dialogs/settings/ksettingsonlinequotes.ui&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Replace member functions of WebPriceQuote with that of AlkOnlineQuotesWidget and i.e AlkOnlineQuotesWidget::debugWidget() in dialogs/settings/kset1tingsonlinequotes.cpp(h).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>A significant part of my project is to work on improvements. While starting the project I found that the above UI and the functionality part to create the online quotes page is already written in the libalkimia (master). After implementing the page I noticed a crash when there was some interaction done on the UI buttons or textboxes. By this, I initially thought that it may be due to some slot. Also, the online quotes data weren&amp;rsquo;t visible on the online quotes that were in the kmymoneyrc config file. I fetched the traceback through the Dr Konqi wizard. It was due to a segmentation fault in a slot. I traced the specified line of code in the log. It pointed me to the function which is used to read the kmymoneyrc file.&lt;/p>
&lt;center>&lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l3q2Mdm0cRPLPcuGI/giphy.gif" width="55%" alt="giphy gif">&lt;/center>
&lt;p>This was my first time working on a project with such a large codebase(although I worked in small bugs) and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t acquainted with a C++ debugger. I learnt to use the KDevelop debugger. I was stuck in that bug so I asked for directions from my mentors. &lt;a href="https://invent.kde.org/tbaumgart">Thomas&lt;/a> sir suggested running the program in the debugger mode and watch the variables and functions. I stepped in the functions associated with those to study those functions. My mentor (&lt;a href="https://invent.kde.org/tbaumgart">Thomas&lt;/a> sir) pointed that it is an error due to a null pointer with some intriguing question to look upon to find that bug.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After this long discussion and help from my mentor, I managed to solve the issue by assigning online quotes profiles when the list is empty before creating the page. Because that null pointer (in libalkimia) was not assigned any value in case of empty quotes profile list and that pointer is used in two functions.&lt;/p>
&lt;center>&lt;img src="https://suraj-sloth.github.io/assets/gsoc21-week1n2.png" width="100%" alt="giphy gif">&lt;/center>
&lt;p>My work can be found &lt;a href="https://invent.kde.org/surajsloth/kmymoney/-/tree/gsoc21">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-next--">What&amp;rsquo;s next -&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My week 3 and week 4 is planned for writing unit tests. But, in the community bonding meet, &lt;a href="https://invent.kde.org/habacker">Ralf&lt;/a> sir said to me that tests are already written. So, I will be running those tests and working on that if something is missing. Also, the &amp;ldquo;add quote source&amp;rdquo; button seems disabled that is need to be figured out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Hello everyone, I hope that you are safe and healthy.
It was the 17th May 2021, the results were to be notified at 11:30 PM IST. My friend &lt;a href="https://invent.kde.org/anjani">Anjani&lt;/a> from the same college as mine, who is also a contributor to the KDE Community called me up 1 hour before the results. We both were very anxious. I checked my email at 11:26 PM, there was a mail that my &lt;a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6042427250442240">project&lt;/a> was accepted in &lt;a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code&lt;/a>. I called up Anjani since the results were to be notified at 11:30 PM IST and he hung up my call in panic. He called back, we were excited that both of our projects got accepted in KDE, one of the largest free software community that we are part of.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="about-my-project">About my Project:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://kmymoney.org">KMyMoney&lt;/a> is a cross-platform personal finance tracking app. It uses C++, Qt as its core and the UI is done using QtWidgets. KMyMoney 4.8 is equipped with debug functions and extended by an online update of the quote sources. This was added to Alkimia 8. The main goal of the project is to add that as a feature to KMyMoney version 5. I have planned to add this support to version 5 of KMyMoney, as a replacement for existing functionality in KMyMoney (as was done with version 4.8). I will be working on the integration of the new functionalities from the Alkimia 8 library to improve the online price update of KMyMoney.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I am glad to have such supporting mentors. I recall the covid cases were rising in India back then in May, Thomas sir sent me a touching base mail to discuss a merge request and asked about my health.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had a KMyMoney kickoff virtual meet on 29th May. We got to know about each other and saw some faces behind the names and email addresses. It was great to interact with mentors, who are in Technology and Engineering for more than two decades and maintaining the KMyMoney codebase for more than one decade.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We walked through the proposed timeline and discussed what more things we will have to figure out while working on the project with some QnA.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also completed one pending merge request:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://invent.kde.org/office/kmymoney/-/merge_requests/68">Remove hide closed accounts option from configuration settings&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I also met my fellow students working on different GSoC projects under various orgs. They were from versatile technology domains. We discussed various topics related to tech and non-tech.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Hello KDE people, I am &lt;a href="https://invent.kde.org/users/surajsloth">Suraj&lt;/a> an undergraduate student majoring in Information Technology from India. I have been contributing to KDE Websites for quite a while. KDE Web has been undergoing major changes in the past few years. We have seen many sites being ported to JAM Stack i.e particularly static site generators such as Hugo and Jekyll.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using static site generators sometimes are a great choice because it reduces server dependencies since the website rebuilds only when the site is updated. Also, updating is a lot easier when the content is written in markdown and simple data formats.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will be working under &lt;a href="https://invent.kde.org/carlschwan">Carl Schwan&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://invent.kde.org/anujbansal">Anuj Bansal&lt;/a> to port the docs.kde.org site to Hugo. It uses a python script to fetch the newest version of the documentation from Git (for English) and Subversion (for other languages) and build HTML and PDF files from the DocBook sources. The custom python script is also to be refactored.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I look forward to this &lt;strong>kool&lt;/strong> and enthralling Season of KDE to improve the docs site. I will be posting regular updates throughout my proposed timeline. Please reach out to me on matrix ( suraj_sloth:kde.org ) if you have any suggestions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Noob design guide!</title><link>https://suraj-sloth.github.io/noob-design-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://suraj-sloth.github.io/noob-design-guide/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="definitve-design-guide-for-designers">Definitve design guide for Designers&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Technology was supposed to let us solve these problems. But technology never solves things by itself. At bottom, it requires people to sit down and build tools that solve them. Which, as long as programmers are all competing to create the world’s most popular timewaster, it doesn’t seem like anyone is going to do.
