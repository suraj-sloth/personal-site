However, spiritual teachings across various traditions emphasize detachment from material desires. This paradox poses a fundamental question: Can the credit-driven pursuit of material wealth coexist with spirituality?</p><p>Purushartha i.e. the objective of a human being states about four aims, one of which is artha . Multiple texts bring different dimensions to it, one of which is Kautilya&rsquo;s Arthashastra. To the Indian context credit in retail banking is quite a new concept.</p><p>In today&rsquo;s wild world, it feels like everywhere you turn, someone&rsquo;s pitching a sale. Ads scream about flashy lifestyles, and our social feeds are a constant stream of the latest &ldquo;gotta-have-it&rdquo; things. They all say, &ldquo;Get this, and life&rsquo;s a breeze!&rdquo;</p><p>But here&rsquo;s the twist: more research suggests that all this chasing after stuff might actually be making us sadder. A 2018 study in the Journal of Consumer Research found that folks fixated on owning things tend to feel less satisfied with life. It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re too caught up in what others think and in having flashy status symbols, forgetting what really counts&mdash;like connections and personal growth [1]. The pressure to buy might really be messing with people&rsquo;s heads in this attention economy.</p><p>It is about easy credit, too. Those tempting loans and cards that make it too easy to splash cash we don&rsquo;t have. turns out, that&rsquo;s part of the problem too. Overspending and stacking up debt can feel like a rollercoaster of stress and anxiety, messing with our heads big time. Debt can pile on feelings of guilt, fear of missing out and ego.</p><p>So, what&rsquo;s the fix? Some psychologists, like Tim Kasser, say we&rsquo;ve got to switch gears. Instead of chasing after stuff, they reckon we should focus on things that actually make us happy&mdash;like building relationships, growing personally, and getting involved in our communities.</p><p>Seems like maybe we&rsquo;ve got it backward. It&rsquo;s not about what we own; it&rsquo;s about what we do and who we are. Maybe it&rsquo;s time to get into spirituality and consider the idea of bowing down to the wealth that brings peace and fills the body with joy.</p><p>Citations:\</p><ul><li>[1] Belk, R.
