Hello I am Suraj. I am a Bachelor of Technology graduate with majors in Information Technology. I love to explore many things from tech, design, product to running. Currently I work as an engineer in one of the SRE teams in my organization. I have been part of open source programs like GSoC and SoK.I used to contribute to KDE Community(<a href="https://kde.org">kde.org</a>). Have a look at my blogs related to all my experiences. The blog was previously managed using Jekyll.
