Consumerism perpetuates the notion that happiness is linked to material possessions. However, spiritual teachings across various traditions emphasize detachment from material desires. This paradox poses a fundamental question: Can the credit-driven pursuit of material wealth coexist with spirituality?

Purushartha i.e. the objective of a human being states about four aims, one of which is artha . Multiple texts bring different dimensions to it, one of which is Kautilya's Arthashastra. To the Indian context credit in retail banking is quite a new concept.

In today's wild world, it feels like everywhere you turn, someone's pitching a sale. Ads scream about flashy lifestyles, and our social feeds are a constant stream of the latest "gotta-have-it" things. They all say, "Get this, and life's a breeze!"

But here's the twist: more research suggests that all this chasing after stuff might actually be making us sadder. A 2018 study in the Journal of Consumer Research found that folks fixated on owning things tend to feel less satisfied with life. It's like they're too caught up in what others think and in having flashy status symbols, forgetting what really counts---like connections and personal growth [1]. The pressure to buy might really be messing with people's heads in this attention economy.

It is about easy credit, too. Those tempting loans and cards that make it too easy to splash cash we don't have. turns out, that's part of the problem too. Overspending and stacking up debt can feel like a rollercoaster of stress and anxiety, messing with our heads big time. Debt can pile on feelings of guilt, fear of missing out and ego.

So, what's the fix? Some psychologists, like Tim Kasser, say we've got to switch gears. Instead of chasing after stuff, they reckon we should focus on things that actually make us happy---like building relationships, growing personally, and getting involved in our communities.

Seems like maybe we've got it backward. It's not about what we own; it's about what we do and who we are. Maybe it's time to get into spirituality and consider the idea of bowing down to the wealth that brings peace and fills the body with joy.
